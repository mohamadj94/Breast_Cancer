Here is a possible summary for a README file:

Breast Cancer Classification Dataset

This dataset consists of 569 observations of breast cancer cell features, with 30 features and a binary outcome variable (malignant or benign).
The data was collected from digitized images of breast tissue, and the features represent the characteristics of each cell.

This dataset is a popular benchmark for machine learning classification tasks. 
It has been used in a variety of studies to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

The dataset is available for download from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


The purpose of this project is to practice and learn different machine learning models for training, testing, and measuring machine accuracy using different models.
As you will see in the project, we have used the following models:

* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* LinearRegression
* Gaussian

We have also practiced hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy in machine learning models.
